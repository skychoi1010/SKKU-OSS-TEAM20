## Implementation of Main Function

### Travel time

### Weather at destination

### Outfit
An algorithm was written in JavaScript to recommend outfits according to the temparature information obtained from 'Weather at destination' function.
It categorizes temperatures into eight ranges and recommends overcoats, tops, and bottoms for each range. 

### Restaurant
Kakao OpenApi provide KakaoMap Api

### List of genres that can be recommended by weather
Spotify API provide track recommendation generated by the seeds infomation which is combination of several genre, tracks and artists. So, we make playlist in user's spotify account according to recommendation.
