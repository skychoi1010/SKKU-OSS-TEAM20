## Implementation of Main Function

### Travel time
Google Maps API provides distance matrix to calculate the travel time from the departure point to the destination by public transportation. Google Geocoder API is used to translate text input address into geographic coordinates(longitude and latitude).

### Weather at destination
OpenWeather API provides current weather data for over 200,000 cities around the world. Google Geocoder API is used to translate text input address into geographic coordinates(longitude and latitude) and give them as inputs. We provide weather information of user's destination.

### Outfit
An algorithm was written in JavaScript to recommend outfits according to the temperature information obtained from 'Weather at destination' function.
It categorizes temperatures into eight ranges and recommends overcoats, tops, and bottoms for each range.

### Restaurant
Kakao OpenApi provide KakaoMap API. So we easily search restaurants or cafes nearby destination and show them.

### List of genres that can be recommended by weather
Spotify API provide track recommendation generated by the seeds information which is combination of several genre, tracks and artists. So, we make playlist in user's spotify account according to recommendation.

***However, this API has limitation in small project. (public request procedure is very complicated. ;() Before use this function, we must enroll your email in our Spotify API dashboard. If not, it makes useless Oauth access code. So, before the use, plz contact awzs159@gmail.com.***
